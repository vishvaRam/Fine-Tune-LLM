            "question": "How should Nodal/Focal Point branches report April 2023 transactions, and how should they differentiate them from March Residual Transactions in their reporting?",
            "ground_truth_answer": "Nodal/Focal Point branches must submit a monthly statement for April transactions to Zonal Accounts Officers/Pay and Accounts Officers in the usual format. To differentiate between April transactions (financial year 2023-24) and March Residual Transactions, the statement pertaining to March Residual Transactions should be clearly marked as \"March Residual Account\".",
            "generated_answer": "To report Nodal/Focal Point branches for April 2023 transactions, you should:\n\n1. Identify all transactions that occurred during April 2023.\n2. Determine which of these transactions were part of the Nodal/Focal Point branch's operations.\n3. Report these transactions as if they were March residual transactions.\n\nFor example:\n- If a transaction was made on April 15th, it would be reported as an April 2023 transaction.\n- If a transaction was made on April 20th, it would be considered a March residual transaction because it did not occur during April 2023.\n\nThis approach ensures that both types of transactions are accurately categorized and reported according to the rules set by the RBI.",
